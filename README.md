# Task8
In this task, I applied K-Means clustering to the Mall Customer dataset. I used the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters, performed PCA for 2D visualization, and evaluated clustering performance using the Silhouette Score.

Tools Used:
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn -> for plotting
- Scikit-learn -> for K-Means, PCA, and silhouette evaluation
